## Catalog Course Description

Introduction to programming and computational thinking through lab and lecture. Simple and structured data types and program control structures. Problem analysis, algorithm design and implementation using a high-level language. Prerequisite: MTH 110

## Why Take This Course?

Computational thinking is a critical skill to develop whether you are pursuing a career in a computing field or simply pursuing your own curiosity.  We will explore problem solving strategies and algorithmic thinking that develop your logical reasoning.  You will gain proficiency in object-oriented design and see different application areas for programming.  These words all sound great, but what do they mean for you?  Over the course of this semester, you’ll be building critical thinking and problem solving skills to process a problem, break it down into its constituent parts, and craft a solution.  Building these skills and learning a language (both programming language and terminology) in which to carry out this process is the ultimate goal of this course.   

## AI Use Policy

The introduction of LLM code tools such as GitHub CoPilot and ChatGPT are actively changing how software is developed.  In just the past two years we’ve seen these tools widely adopted across industry and many stories about the nature of coding work changing.  While that is the case, the most crucial skills that employers desire are critical thinking and problem solving.  Jobs of the future will still require graduates who have the ability to break down and solve complex problems.  Although the apparent focus in this course is on essential programming skills, you are beginning a journey to see the world through a computational lens.  While you will use AI tools in your future work, it won’t replace a human problem solver.  Considering this reality, you are allowed to use AI as a tool to assist you when completing your programming projects.  However, they must be used as a tool; you are not allowed to use them to replace thinking.  When AI is permitted, you will be required to upload your transcripts.  You are always expected to fully understand the work you submit.  If you choose to use AI, be warned:  you must complete the exams without the use of AI tools and you must do sufficiently well on the exams in order to pass the course.  I will work with you all in class to explore what it means to be able to read code, understand code, and troubleshoot.  As we navigate this journey, I want you to know from the start the importance of developing your own coding literacy while also being able to effectively leverage AI tools.

## Help - Academic Support and Tutoring

This course requires patience and persistence as computational thinking/programming is a craft.  It will likely be challenging.  We are committed to your success and want to be your first source for help.  Please ask questions before, during and after class as well as visit during office hours.  I, myself, am happy to meet at other times as well.  Beyond your instructor, the Computing Success Center is a great place to find help.  Free drop-in tutoring for CIS 162 is available during specific hours during the week but it is also a great space to hang out and work with others on group work!  See [Success Center](https://www.gvsu.edu/computing/student-success-center-13.htm)  for a current schedule.  You can also contact the [GVSU tutoring center](http://www.gvsu.edu/tc/) for one-on-one tutoring.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this course, students should be able to:

- Read and understand source code
- Solve problems using conditional statements
- Solve problems using repetition statements
- Use variables and data structures to store, retrieve, and manipulate data
- Explain the concepts of object state and behavior
- Implement a class definition given specifications
- Identify and fix bugs

## Learning Management System

Course documents, videos, assignments, grades, links, and announcements will be posted to Blackboard.  

Labs and projects will be posted and completed on PrairieLearn. It is your responsibility to stay informed.

## Programming Language and IDE

This courses uses [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  We use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the free development tool.

## Textbooks / Resources

In order to keep costs low, we will be using a variety of free online resources to introduce you to the Python programming language.  While no textbook is required, we strongly encourage you to set aside time to read through the recommended materials as they complement in-class activities.

Our main e-textbook is “Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition” by Eric Matthes.  It is available for free through our library at the following link: https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-crash-course/9781098156664.  Choose the option to log in with your institution, enter “Grand Valley State University” and then use your student email login.

## Lab Activities

Our class is structured as a fully online, asynchronous course. Instead of meeting in a physical lab each week, you will complete weekly lab modules posted on PrairieLearn. To receive credit, you must complete all assigned tasks with your own original work (e.g., simply pasting the entire lab into an AI tool without doing the work yourself will not receive credit). Each week, you will be given a lab activity that must be submitted by the deadline before the next module opens. 

## Programming Projects

Projects will also be posted on PrairieLearn. Projects are completed on your own time outside of class. The three projects increase in complexity as your abilities improve.  You will need to start early and budget enough time to complete the projects. 

While a certain amount of consultation between students working on a project is encouraged, the work you submit must be your own. Do not create a difficult situation by representing someone else's work as your own.  Make sure you cite your resources. For more information, consult the [Student Code](https://www.gvsu.edu/policies/category.htm?categoryId=2D0C8EF7-9959-9B01-959C403E725313F3), and the [College of Computing Guidelines for Academic Honesty](https://www.gvsu.edu/computing/academic-honesty-30.htm).


## Midterm Exams

You will complete two midterm exams online, asynchronously. These exams are designed to assess your understanding of key concepts and your ability to apply problem-solving skills. Each exam will be available within a specified time window, and you must complete it by the posted deadline.

## Lab Exam

You will complete a lab exam towards the end of the term.  This is your opportunity to demonstrate your abilities working alone at a computer during the regularly scheduled lab session.  The lab exam is open notes and open book.


## Final Exam

The final exam will be available on Saturday, December 6th, from 9:00AM - 3PM (EST). You must complete and submit the exam within that window to receive credit.

## Course Policies

- You must earn a combined average of at least 60% between the midterm exams, lab exam and final exam to pass the course.
- All programming projects, unless otherwise specified by the instructor, are to be completed individually. Students are encouraged to work with each other for general help only.
- Projects and labs turned in late occur a penalty of 10% per day, up to 3 days late.  In general, projects and labs turned in more than 3 days late will not receive credit.  Life happens, if you have extenuating circumstances, please talk with me.  
- There will be a number of in-class activities graded throughout the semester.  They will be unannounced and to receive credit you must be in class.  You are allowed to miss one in-class activity.  If you attend the Success Center for at least 10 unique weeks during the semester, you are allowed to miss one additional activity (you must check-in and stay for a minimum of 30 minutes).
- The instructor reserves the right to modify course policies, the course calendar, and due dates with sufficient notice via email and in-class announcements.

## Academic Honesty

All students are expected to adhere to the academic honesty standards set forth by Grand Valley State University. In addition, students in this course are expected to adhere to the academic honesty guidelines as set forth by the School of Computing and Information Systems, details can be found at [College of Computing Academic Honesty](https://www.gvsu.edu/computing/academic-honesty-30.htm).

I believe that you can learn a lot from your peers, both in the class and in the broader community. Therefore, I encourage collaboration with both.  However, do not mistake this as a license to cheat.   It is one thing to learn from and with your peers, it is another to pass their work off as your own.   With respect to writing code for this class:

- You are expected to document any collaboration that takes place.
- No electronic transfer of code between students is permitted.
- Any code that you find on the Internet must be cited, with an active link to that code. 
- While you are encouraged to engage in conversations in online forums, do not post solutions or solicit others to complete your work for you.
- Ultimately, you are responsible for all aspects of your submissions.  You should be able to explain and defend your submission if the work is entirely your own.
